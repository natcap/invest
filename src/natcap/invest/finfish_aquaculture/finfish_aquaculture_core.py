    Writes an HTML file containing 3 tables that summarize inputs and outputs

            harvest, number of fish in farm, start day for growing, and
            length of fallowing period
        - Output Table 1: Farm Harvesting data, including a summary table
            for each harvest cycle of each farm. Will show Farm ID, cycle
            number, days since outplanting date, harvested weight, net
            revenue, outplant day, and year.
        - Output Table 2: Model outputs for each farm, including Farm ID,
            net present value, number of completed harvest cycles, and
            total volume harvested.

    Args:
        output_html_path: The output html file path.
        cycle_history: dictionary mapping farm ID->list of tuples, each of
            which contains 3 things- (day of outplanting, day of harvest,
            harvest weight of a single fish in grams)
        sum_hrv_weight: dictionary which holds a mapping from farm ID->total
            processed weight of each farm
        hrv_weight: dictionary which holds a farm->list mapping, where the list
            holds the individual tpw for all cycles that the farm completed
        do_valuation: boolean variable that says whether or not valuation is
            desired
        farms_npv: dictionary with a farm-> float mapping, where each float is
            the net processed value of the fish processed on that farm, in
            $1000s of dollars.
        value_history: dictionary which holds a farm->list mapping, where the
