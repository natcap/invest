"""
Implements the Wang et al (2000) viewshed based on reference planes.

This algorithm was originally described in "Generating viewsheds without using
sightlines", authored by Jianjun Wang, Gary J. Robertson, and Kevin White,
published in Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing, Vol. 66, No. 1,
January 2000, pp. 87-90.

Calculations for adjusting the required height for curvature of the earth have
been adapted from the ESRI ArcGIS documentation:
http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/using-viewshed-and-observer-points-for-visibility.htm

Consistent with the routing functionality of pygeoprocessing, neighbor
directions follow the right-hand rule where neighbor indexes are interpreted
as:

    # 321
    # 4X0
    # 567

    Args:
        dem_raster_path_band (tuple): A tuple of (path, band_index) where
            ``path`` is a path to a GDAL-compatible raster on disk and
            ``band_index`` is the 1-based band index.  This DEM must be tiled
            with block sizes as a power of 2.  If the viewshed is being
            adjusted for curvature of the earth and/or refraction, the
            elevation units of the DEM must be in meters.  The DEM need not be
            projected in meters.
        viewpoint (tuple):  A tuple of 2 numbers in the order
            ``(east offset, north offset)``.  These units must be of the same
            units as the coordinate system of the DEM.  This index represents
            the viewpoint location.  The closest pixel to this viewpoint index
            will be used as the viewpoint.
        visibility_filepath (string): A filepath on disk to where the
            visibility raster will be written. If a raster exists in this
            location, it will be overwritten.
        viewpoint_height=0.0 (float):  The height (in the units of the DEM
            height) of the observer at the viewpoint.
        curved_earth=True (bool): Whether to adjust viewshed calculations for
            the curvature of the earth.  If False, the earth will be treated as
            though it is flat.
        refraction_coeff=0.13 (float):  The coefficient of atmospheric
            refraction that may be adjusted to accommodate varying atmospheric
            conditions.  Default is ``0.13``.  Set to ``0`` to ignore
            refraction calculations.
        max_distance=None (float):  If provided, visibility will not be
            calculated for DEM pixels that are more than this distance (in meters)
            from the viewpoint.
        aux_filepath=None (string): A path to a location on disk
            where the raster containing the auxiliary matrix will be written.
            The auxiliary matrix defines the height that a DEM must exceed in
            order to be visible from the viewpoint.  This matrix is very useful
            for debugging.  If a raster already exists at this location, it
            will be overwritten.  If this path is not provided by the user, the
            viewshed will create this file as a temporary file wherever the
            system keeps its temp files and remove it when the viewshed
            finishes.  See python's ``tempfile`` documentation for where this
            might be on your system.

    Raises:
        ValueError: When either the viewpoint does not overlap with the DEM or
            the DEM is not tiled appropriately.

        LookupError: When the ``viewpoint`` coordinate pair is over nodata.

        AssertionError: When pixel dimensions are not square.

    Returns:
