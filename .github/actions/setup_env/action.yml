description:
  "This action creates a conda environment containing a given python version
  and set of requirements. It caches the environment and restores it from
  the cache when possible to minimize execution time. It uses a cache key
  that includes the runner OS and architecture, python version, hash of all
  requirements, and the number of the week in the year, so that the cache
  refreshes weekly."
