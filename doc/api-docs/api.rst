API Reference
=============

.. Note::

    For the entrypoint to each model, see :ref:`models`. The InVEST graphic 
    user interface interacts with the models through these entrypoints. If you 
    want to use the models as they are, such as to automate runs, you should 
    only access the entrypoint function of each model.

    If however you want to modify a model, or only use certain components, see
    below for the complete API reference.
