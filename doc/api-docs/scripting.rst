*************************************
Tutorial: Batch Processing on Windows
*************************************

============
Introduction
============

These are the steps that will need to be taken in order to use the batch
scripting framework for InVEST models available in the ``natcap.invest`` python
package.

For those wishing to do batch-processing with InVEST without setting up a
Python scripting environment, see :ref:`cli` for examples of how to run
InVEST models from the command-line.

==================================
Setting up your Python environment
==================================

1. **Install Python 3.6 or later.**

   Python can be `downloaded from here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.  When installing,
   be sure to allow ``python.exe`` to be added to the path in the installation options.


2. **Put pip on the PATH.**

   The ``pip`` utility for installing python packages is already included with
   Python 2.7.9 and later. Be sure to add ``C:\Python37\Scripts`` (or your custom
   install location) to the Windows PATH environment variable so that ``pip`` can
   be called from the command line without needing to use its full path.

   After this is done (and you've opened a new command-line window), you will be
   able to use ``pip`` at the command-line to install packages like so::

    > pip install <packagename>

3. **Install packages needed to run InVEST.**

   Most (maybe even all) of these packages can be downloaded as precompiled
   wheels from `Christoph Gohlke's build page <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_.
   Others should be able to be installed via ``pip install <packagename>``.

    .. This ..include:: part will automatically pull the contents of requirements.txt
       and include the file from line 9 through the end.

    .. include:: ../../requirements.txt
        :literal:
        :start-line: 9


4. **Install the InVEST python package**

   4a. Download a release of the ``natcap.invest`` python package.

       * `Releases on the python package index <https://pypi.org/project/natcap.invest/#files>`_

   4b. Install the downloaded python package..

       * ``win32.whl`` files are prebuilt binary distributions and can be
         installed via pip.
         See the `pip docs for installing a package from a wheel
         <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#installing-from-wheels>`_
       * ``.zip`` and ``.tar.gz`` files are source archives.
         See :ref:`installing` for details, including how to
         install specific development versions of ``natcap.invest``.


.. _CreatingSamplePythonScripts:

==============================
Creating Sample Python Scripts
==============================

1. **Launch InVEST Model**

   Once an InVEST model is selected for scripting,
   launch that model from the Windows Start menu.  This example in this guide
   follows the NDR model.

2. **Fill in InVEST Model Input Parameters**

   Once the user interface loads, populate the inputs in the model likely to
   be used in the Python script.  For testing purposes the default InVEST’s
   data is appropriate.  However, if a user wishes to write a batch for several
   InVEST runs, it would be reasonable to populate the user interface with
   data for the first run.

3. **Generate a sample Python Script from the User Interface**

   Open the Development menu at the top of the user interface and select
   *"Save to python script..."* and save the file to a known location.

4. **Execute the script in the InVEST Python Environment**

   Launch a Windows PowerShell from the Start menu (type “powershell” in the
   search box), then invoke the Python interpreter on the InVEST Python
   script from that shell.  In this example the Python interpreter is
   installed in ``C:\Python37\python.exe`` and the script was saved in
   ``C:\Users\rpsharp\Desktop\ndr.py``, thus the command to invoke the
   interpreter is::

    > C:\Python37\python.exe C:\Users\rpsharp\Desktop\ndr.py

5. **Output Results**

   As the model executes, status information will be printed to the console.
   Once complete, model results can be found in the workspace folder selected
   during the initial configuration.

=========================
Modifying a Python Script
=========================

InVEST Python scripts consist of two sections:

* The argument dictionary that represents the model’s user interface input
  boxes and parameters.
* The call to the InVEST model itself.

For reference, consider the following script generated by the Nutrient model with default data inputs:

.. code-block:: python

    """
    This is a saved model run from natcap.invest.ndr.ndr.
    Generated: Mon 16 May 2016 03:52:59 PM
    InVEST version: 3.3.0
    """

    import natcap.invest.ndr.ndr

    args = {
            u'k_param': u'2',
            u'runoff_proxy_uri': u'C:\InVEST_3.3.0_x86\Base_Data\Freshwater\precip',
            u'subsurface_critical_length_n': u'150',
            u'subsurface_critical_length_p': u'150',
            u'subsurface_eff_n': u'0.8',
            u'subsurface_eff_p': u'0.8',
            u'threshold_flow_accumulation': u'1000',
            u'biophysical_table_uri': u'C:\InVEST_3.3.0_x86\WP_Nutrient_Retention\Input\water_biophysical_table.csv',
            u'calc_n': True,
            u'calc_p': True,
            u'suffix': '',
            u'dem_uri': u'C:\InVEST_3.3.0_x86\Base_Data\Freshwater\dem',
            u'lulc_uri': u'C:\InVEST_3.3.0_x86\Base_Data\Freshwater\landuse_90',
            u'watersheds_uri': u'C:\InVEST_3.3.0_x86\Base_Data\Freshwater\watersheds.shp',
            u'workspace_dir': u'C:\InVEST_3.3.0_x86\ndr_workspace',
    }

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        natcap.invest.ndr.ndr.execute(args)

Elements to note:

* *Parameter Python Dictionary*: Key elements include the ``‘args’`` dictionary.  Note the similarities between the key values such as ``‘workspace_dir’`` and the equivalent “Workspace” input parameter in the user interface.  Every key in the ``‘args’`` dictionary has a corresponding reference in the user interface.

.. |95zj7p.png| image:: https://bitbucket.org/repo/ag8qdk/images/22613179-95zj7p.png

In the example below we’ll modify the script to execute the nutrient model for a parameter study of ``‘threshold_flow_accumulation’.``

* *Execution of the InVEST model*: The InVEST API invokes models with a consistent syntax where the module name that contains the InVEST model is listed first and is followed by a function called ‘execute’ that takes a single parameter called ``‘args’``. This parameter is the dictionary of input parameters discussed above.  In this example, the line

``natcap.invest.ndr.ndr.execute(args)``

executes the nutrient model end-to-end.  If the user wishes to make batch calls to InVEST, this line will likely be placed inside a loop.

====================================================
Example: Threshold Flow Accumulation Parameter Study
====================================================

This example executes the InVEST NDR model on 10 values of threshold
accumulation stepping from 500 to 1000 pixels in steps of 50.  To modify the
script above, replace the execution call with the following loop:

.. code-block:: python

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        #Loops through the values 500, 550, 600, ... 1000
        for threshold_flow_accumulation in range(500, 1001, 50):
            #set the accumulation threshold to the current value in the loop
            args['threshold_flow_accumulation'] = threshold_flow_accumulation
            #set the suffix to be accum### for the current threshold_flow_accumulation
            args['suffix'] = 'accum' + str(threshold_flow_accumulation)
            natcap.invest.ndr.ndr.execute(args)

This loop executes the InVEST nutrient model 10 times for accumulation values
``500, 550, 600, ... 1000`` and adds a suffix to the output files so results
can be distinguished.

===========================================================
Example: Invoke NDR Model on a directory of Land Cover Maps
===========================================================

In this case we invoke the InVEST nutrient model on a directory of land cover
data located at C:\User\Rich\Desktop\landcover_data.  As in the previous
example, replace the last line in the UI generated Python script with:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    landcover_dir = r'C:\User\Rich\Desktop\landcover_data'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        #Loop over all the filenames in the landcover dir
        for landcover_file in os.listdir(landcover_dir):
            #Point the landuse uri parameter at the directory+filename
            args['lulc_uri'] = os.path.join(landcover_dir, landcover_file)
            #Make a useful suffix so we can differentiate the results
            args['suffix'] = 'landmap' + os.path.splitext(landcover_file)[0]
            #call the nutrient model
            natcap.invest.ndr.ndr.execute(args)

This loop covers all the files located in
``C:\User\Rich\Desktop\landcover_data``
and updates the relevant ``lulc_uri`` key in the args dictionary to each
of those files during execution as well as making a useful suffix so output
files can be distinguished from each other.

============================================
Example: Saving model log messages to a file
============================================

There are many cases where you may want or need to capture all of the log
messages generated by the model.  When we run models through the InVEST user
interface application, the UI captures all of this logging and saves it to a
logfile.  We can replicate this behavior through the python logging package,
by adding the following code just after the ``import`` statements in the
example script.


.. code-block:: python

    import logging
    import pygeoprocessing

    # Write all NDR log messages to logfile.txt
    MODEL_LOGGER = logging.getLogger('natcap.invest.ndr')
    handler = logging.FileHandler('logfile.txt')
    MODEL_LOGGER.addHandler(handler)

    # log pygeoprocessing messages to the same logfile
    PYGEO_LOGGER = logging.getLogger('pygeoprocessing')
    PYGEO_LOGGER.addHandler(handler)

This will capture all logging generated by the ``ndr`` model and by
``pygeoprocessing``, writing all messages to ``logfile.txt``.  While
this is a common use case, the ``logging`` package provides functionality
for many more complex logging features.  For more
advanced use of the python logging module, refer to the Python project's
`Logging Cookbook <https://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging-cookbook.html>`_

=====================================
Example: Enabling Parallel Processing
=====================================

.. note::
   This is an in-development feature and should be used with caution.

Most InVEST models accept an optional entry in the ``args`` dictionary
representing the number of parallel workers.  Acceptable values for this
number are:

* ``-1``, representing synchronous execution (this is the default across
  InVEST)
* ``0`` representing threaded task management
* Any other positive integer represents the number of processes that will be
  created to handle tasks.  ``2*multiprocessing.cpu_count()`` is usually a good
  number.

.. warning::
   If you use this feature, you **must** wrap your script in a
   ``if __name__ == '__main__':`` condition.  Failure to do so will result
   in a fork bomb (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb).

Using the parameter study example, this might look like:

.. code-block:: python

    if __name__ == '__main__':
       args['n_workers'] = 4  # Use 4 processes

       #Loops through the values 500, 550, 600, ... 1000
       for threshold_flow_accumulation in range(500, 1001, 50):
           #set the accumulation threshold to the current value in the loop
           args['threshold_flow_accumulation'] = threshold_flow_accumulation
           #set the suffix to be accum### for the current threshold_flow_accumulation
           args['suffix'] = 'accum' + str(threshold_flow_accumulation)
           natcap.invest.ndr.ndr.execute(args)


====================
Internationalization
====================

If you use the InVEST python API to access model names, ``ARGS_SPEC``s, or validation messages, you can translate those strings using ``gettext``:

.. code-block:: python

    from natcap.invest import set_locale

    # replace with your desired ISO 639-1 language code
    # see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes
    set_locale('en')
    import natcap.invest.carbon
    ...

See the `GNU gettext manual <https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html>`_ and the `Python gettext documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html>`_ for more information.
