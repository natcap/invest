  InVEST® is a suite of free, open-source software models
  used to map and value the goods and services from nature
  that sustain and fulfill human life.  If properly managed,
  ecosystems yield a flow of services that are vital to
  humanity, including the production of goods (e.g., food),
  life-support processes (e.g., water purification), and
  life-fulfilling conditions (e.g., beauty, opportunities
  for recreation), and the conservation of options (e.g.,
  genetic diversity for future use).  Despite its
  importance, this natural capital is poorly understood,
  scarcely monitored, and, in many cases, undergoing rapid
  degradation and depletion.


  Governments, non-profits, international lending
  institutions, and corporations all manage natural
  resources for multiple uses and inevitably must evaluate
  tradeoffs among them. The multi-service, modular design of
  InVEST provides an effective tool for balancing the
  environmental and economic goals of these diverse
  entities.


  InVEST enables decision makers to assess quantified
  tradeoffs associated with alternative management choices
  and to identify areas where investment in natural capital
  can enhance human development and conservation.  The
  toolset includes distinct ecosystem service models
  designed for terrestrial, freshwater, marine, and coastal
  ecosystems, as well as a number of “helper tools” to
  assist with locating and processing input data and with
  understanding and visualizing outputs.
